# Run the curated security regression test suite.
#
# This is the "no more security regressions" safety net requested after the
# 2026-08 security audit: every access-control / tenant-isolation /
# secret-handling fix gets a regression test, and every such test file is
# listed in scripts/security_test_manifest.txt so it always runs here — on
# every push/PR (see .github/workflows/security-tests.yml) and locally
# before shipping a patch.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_security_tests.sh            # run the curated suite
#   scripts/run_security_tests.sh -k pattern  # forwarded to pytest

# NOTE: older audit test files used to hard-pin __version__ to the exact
# version at the time they were written (e.g. "4.10.9"), which drifted on
# every release bump and had nothing to do with the security behavior those
# files actually guard. Those assertions were all converted to forward-
# compatible "is_same_or_newer" checks (2026-08), so no deselect list is
# needed here anymore — any failure below is a real regression.
